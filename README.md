# python-games
Some games in Python made out of boredom. Free for any distribution, working on it on your own, using it
as a school project (let me know the mark you've got ^^). If you have any ideas how to improve particular 
games, feel free to do it.

**n-tic-tac-toe.py**: Simple tic tac toe game enlarged to handle n x n board. Two player text based game.

**squares-tkinter.py**: Square clicking game written in tkinter module. The game has multiple levels and 
collects points based on which squares you clicked on. Green square -> +1 point, red square -> -2 points.
With each level the game becomes harder, goal is to get 30 points.
