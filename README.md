# python-games
Some games in Python made out of boredom. Free for any distribution, working on it on your own, using it
as a school project (let me know the mark you've got ^^). If you have any ideas how to improve particular 
games, feel free to do it.

**n-tic-tac-toe.py:** Simple tic tac toe game enlarged to handle n x n board. Two player text based game.

**squares-tkinter.py:** Square clicking game written in tkinter module. The game has multiple levels and 
collects points based on which squares you clicked on. Green square -> +1 point, red square -> -2 points.
With each level the game becomes harder, goal is to get 30 points.

**blackjack-game.py:** Blackjack game, where player plays against bot. Bot is very simple right now. At 
start you get 2 cards and you can either hit (take a new card) or stay (ends the game, bot is on move). 
If your deck exceeds 21, you always lose no matter what cards bot had. If bot's deck exceeds 21, you win. 
If no one's deck exceeds 21, the player with higher deck value wins.
